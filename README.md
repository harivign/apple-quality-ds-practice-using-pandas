Apple Quality Prediction Dataset
Overview
Apples are a staple fruit loved worldwide for their crunchiness, sweetness, and juiciness. But how do we determine if an apple is of good quality or not? This dataset provides a detailed breakdown of various attributes of apples—like size, weight, and acidity—and their associated quality labels.

This project aims to analyze these features to build predictive models that can classify apples into good or bad quality categories.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains 4001 rows with the following attributes:

A_id: Unique identifier for each apple.
Size: Measurement indicating the size of the apple.
Weight: Weight of the apple in grams.
Sweetness: A score measuring the sweetness level.
Crunchiness: A score reflecting how crunchy the apple is.
Juiciness: A score indicating juiciness.
Ripeness: A measure of how ripe the apple is.
Acidity: Numerical measure of the acidity (requires cleanup as it's currently stored as a string).
Quality: Label indicating the quality (good or bad).
Key Questions to Explore
What are the key factors that influence apple quality?
How do the attributes like sweetness and crunchiness vary between good and bad apples?
Can machine learning models accurately predict apple quality based on the given features?
Analysis and Visualizations
The repository contains the following analysis:

Data Cleaning: Preprocessing steps for handling null values and formatting errors.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual insights into the distribution of attributes and their relationship with quality.
Machine Learning Models: Classification models to predict apple quality.
Applications
This analysis can be used for:

Automating quality checks in the agricultural sector.
Building decision-support tools for apple sorting in supply chains.
